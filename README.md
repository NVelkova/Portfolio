## About me
Hello, I am glad you are here and hope you will find my place interesting. 

I am a newbie in the "ocean" called Quality Assurance. I started my journey in the middle of the previous year, and honestly, I was a little skeptical and scared. I wasn't sure what to expect and if I would be good enough to reach the end. But step by step, I understood that there was no end. And that this is not an ocean but a neverending universe.

Now I know that to be a good QA, I can't stop learning every day. But I am a quick learner, so I think I have found my place. I am also a curious, communicative, quality-focused, and self-motivated person.

I wish to exploit my analytical skills and passion for accuracy in software testing. I continue intensively studying new techniques and tools by attending online courses and testing different web applications.

Here you can see what I have learned till now.
